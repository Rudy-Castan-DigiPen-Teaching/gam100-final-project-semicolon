# CS120 Game Snapshot

## Introduction

This assignment will be based off of a snapshot from your GAM100 Final Project assignment. In this assignment you will use C++ and the `doodle` framework to create a game.

GAM100 will grade based off of the game design and game production. CS120 will grade based off of your use of C++.

# Create a ReadMe


Create a **`CS120ReadMe.md`** markdown file that defines the following.

1. Your names, assignment name/number, course name, term
2. Section describing anything incomplete about the assignment
3. Section describing something you're proud of about the assignment
4. Section that lists the File Name and Line Number for all code requirements
    - one example is enough if there are multiple instances
