## Main Contributions
I was responsible for most of the coding. Also, I set the porperties to put the audio.

## personal notes
The floor-to-player collision went well. Also, if the player enters a certain range of the monster, it is infected and HP is reduced well. Also, the boss monsters flying around and attacking the player are well implemented.
And I realized that I had a very poor understanding of coding. For example, I tried to create a gravity and jump code, but it failed. The current code I made is not a proper gravity and jump code. Also, ranged attacks were not implemented properly. If I make a game later in my sophomore year, I will study more and try to implement it.
