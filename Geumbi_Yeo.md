**Main contributions:
I designed and drew all the backgrounds and characters. I made background music. I chose the genre and characteristics of the game.


## It was good that the game came out of higher quality than I thought, 
## and it was regrettable that I could not use all the music I made because I didn't have enough time. 
## It was good to help each other while being with friends.
